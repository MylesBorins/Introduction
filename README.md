It exposes you to people, places, and things that are unfamiliar to you, which can cause some to choose not to take advantage of travel as an opportunity for growth and development. This guide is being created to help those traveling to tech conferences world-wide with the information they need in order to take full advantage of the adventure that world travel provides.

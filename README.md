# Introduction

## What better way to improve inclusion and diversity in tech than through travel? 

Travel enables individuals to explore the world and experience firsthand all that makes our communities special and unique. 

But traveling can also be an uncomfortable and overwhelming experience. It exposes you to people, places, and things that are unfamiliar to you, which can cause some to choose not to take advantage of travel as an opportunity for growth and development. 

This guide is being created to help those traveling to tech conferences world-wide with the information they need in order to take full advantage of the adventure that world travel provides. By contributing to this guide, you are helping to improve inclusion, diversity, and safe spaces in tech.

# Packing

## Absolute Essentials

If need be you could leave for a trip with only the clothing on your back and the items listed below. This is in no way going to be an enjoyable trip, but you will be able to get where you need to go and not be stranded.

* Identification
  - License
  - Passport
* Debit Card
  - Try and find a bank or credit union with 0 fees for foreign currency conversion
* Credit Cards
  - Try and find a card with 0 fees for foreign transactions, airline credit cards often fall in this category]
  - Try and have more than one type. Not every location takes American Express for example.
* Cash
  - try and keep at least $100 in cash on you in case of emergencies
  - if you don't have a debit card with 0 fees you may want to get money exchanged before leaving home country

## Suitcase

If you are travelling for less than a week you might want to try and squeeze everything into a carry-on bag. Luggage can get lost, and on short trips it is especially problematic. The #1 proven way to avoid lost luggage is to not check a bag!

[The Wirecutter](https://thewirecutter.com/) has a great [article about carry-on luggage](https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-carry-on-luggage/) where they suggest the [Travelpro Platinum Magna 2](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00X6JRSSY/) as the best carry-on luggage on the market. They also suggest the [Kirkland Signature Softside Spinner](https://www.costco.com/Kirkland-Signature-Softside-Spinner-22%22-Carry-On.product.100344004.html) as a solid budget pick at $100.

With a combination of [smart packing techniques](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17smmlESBls) and doing laundry, carry on luggage has been known to serve saavy travellers for over two weeks. Keep in mind that this requires hard work and compromise.

## Clothing

Make sure to check the weather for the time you will be visiting. Don't make assumptions.

* As many pairs of underwear as days travelling + 1
* As many pairs of socks as days travelling + 1
* 2 - 3 pairs of pants
* As many shirts as days + 1 (any type of shirt)
* At least one sweater. Add additional sweaters based on how cold it is.
* An appropriate jacket for the weather
* Shorts if appropriate
* A Swimsuit (this one is easy to forget, in any weather there is often a pool or hottub at hotels)
* At least one pair of shoes (you have to wear shoes). If bringing more than one pair ensure options, such as one pair of boots and one pair of runners.
  - *note* if you wear boots onto the plane you can pack running shoes in your backpack in a garment bag or tote (you'll be getting a bunch of those)
* Any necessary outerwear based on the weather (beanie, sunhat, gloves, etc.)

## Toiletries 

Don't forget, if you are packing toiletries in you carry on you may be limited in the size of bottle you can carry on the plane. For example in the U.S. a container must be less than 3.4 ounces by volume. Don't pack things that you don't need. If you are staying in a hotel you may not need to pack shampoo, soup, or conditionar. If you require special products, don't forget them!

Some things you might want to bring include:

* toothbrush
* toothpaste
* floss
* nail clippers
* cortisone (if you ever really need this one you will thank the stars you have it)

## Health & Medical Equipment

Don't forget to bring the following (if applicable)

* Health insurance documentation
* Medication
* Glasses
* Sleep equipment
* Band Aids

## Technology + Adapters

If you are travelling you probably are going to have one of the following with you

* Phone
* Tablet
* Computer

Don't forget to bring the appropriate cables to charge each of them! If you are travelling to a different country it is always a good idea to ensure they use the same type of power adapter and voltate. If not get a power adapter before leaving, they are much more expensive on the toad.

## Entertainment + Accessories

The things on this list are 100% optional, but can come in handy to pass the time.

* Deck of Cards
* Book
* Pen + Paper / Notebook
* Video Game console (Nintendo Switch!)
